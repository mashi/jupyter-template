## ‚ú® Why Use This Template?

This isn't just another folder with a `.ipynb` file. It's a complete development environment designed to bring software engineering rigor to your data science workflow.

*   **ü§ñ Automated Quality Checks**: Pre-commit hooks lint, format, and check your code *and* notebooks before you even commit. Powered by `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, and `nbQA`.
*   **üßπ Clean & Reproducible Notebooks**: Automatically clear notebook outputs to prevent large diffs and keep your version control history clean.
*   **‚úÖ Continuous Integration**: A ready-to-go GitHub Actions workflow validates your code, notebooks, and tests on every push and pull request.
*   **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Auto-Updating Dependencies**: Renovate bot is configured to run monthly, creating pull requests to keep your dependencies fresh and secure. It can even automerge them!
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Simple Setup**: Get up and running in minutes with a single `make` command.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Create your repository**: Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page to create a new repository from this template.
2.  **Clone your new repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
    ```

## üíª Development Workflow

1.  **Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks**:
    On your local machine, run the following command. This will set up your environment and activate the pre-commit hooks that run on every `git commit`.
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
2.  **Start coding!**
    Create or open your Jupyter Notebooks and Python files. When you commit your changes, the pre-commit hooks will automatically check and format your work.

3.  **Run tests**:
    You can manually run all tests and checks with:
    ```bash
    make tests
    ```
